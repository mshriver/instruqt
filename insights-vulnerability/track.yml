title: Remediate vulnerabilities with Red Hat Insights
description: |
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to identify vulnerabilities that
  affect systems registered to Red Hat Insights using the Vulnerability tool. They will also
  learn how to remediate these vulnerabilities.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * View Insights Vulnerability results that are reported for the system on cloud.redhat.com.
  * Apply a recommeded remediation for the system.
  * Validate that the remediation was successful.

  # Example use case:
  You need to report out what systems are impacted by a given vulnerability or generate
  a report showing what CVEs may impact your fleet for auditing purposes.

  Systems are impacted by a new vulnerability for which a remediation exists.
  Administrators would like to apply specific fixes to their systems without the
  need for broader system updates.
