    # Goal:
    After completing this scenario users will be able to create Podman pods, create containers within those pods, and forward ports to the services those containers run.

    # Concepts included in this scenario:
    * Verify whether Podman is installed on the system
    * Create a pod in Podman
    * Run a container inside of a pod in Podman
    * Forward ports to containers within pods.

    # Example Use case:
    An administrator wants to run a service on a Podman container host that has dependent services.

## Validate the environment

>For this scenario, `container-tools` which contains podman and its depenencies, has already been installed on the system.

The feature we will be working with is specific to Podan version 4 and newer, so first let's check that podman 4.0.x is installed on the system.

```bash
podman --version
```

You should see the output below -

<pre class="file">
 # podman --version
podman version 4.0.2
</pre>

With podman verified, we can continue with the scenario.
